# ... fun and backup with ruby and vmware esxi
This is the companion project of my post [backup vmware esxi with a rake (script)](http://blog.zigolab.it/backup-vmware-esxi-with-a-rake-script/)

## setup notes
Rename config/vcenter.yml.sample into config/vcenter.yml and set the actual configuration variables.

P.S. Inside scripts folder you can do the same with the sample shell script files...
