# ... fun and backup with ruby and vmware esxi
This is the companion project of my post [fun and backup with ruby and vmware esxi](http://blog.zigolab.it/fun-and-backup-with-ruby-and-vmware/)

## setup notes
Rename config/vcenter.yml.sample into config/vcenter.yml and set the actual configuration variables.
P.S. Inside scripts folder you can do the same with the sample shell script files...
